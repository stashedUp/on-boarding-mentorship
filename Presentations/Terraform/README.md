Terraform lets you safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure. It is an open source tool that codifies APIs into declarative configuration files that can be shared amongst team members, treated as code, edited, reviewed, and versioned.

As infrastructure providers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Compute evolve and add new features, Hashicorp releases incremental versions of terraform to support these features. So, older projects may be on an older version while newer projects might require a newer version of terraform.
